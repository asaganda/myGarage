# myGarage

Full Stack CRUD App that holds a collection cars in the garage
A user can create, read, update, delete cars in the collection
App running on Node with Express server middleware, Mongo for data storage via Mongoose package, ejs templating language for html, Bootstrap library for navbar and app styling, jQuery for garage door animation, leveraged sessionStorage for loading garage door on first page load only

Unsolved: I came to realize towards later in the project that updating a car form should only allow for value and mileage update because none of the other car properties would be updated..I was just tired to update it
Stretch goals: 
    Wanted to add a garage door sound when garage door goes up when clicked
    File upload/drag and drop area for uploading pics of a car when adding car
